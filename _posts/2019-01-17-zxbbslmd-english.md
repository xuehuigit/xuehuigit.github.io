categories: ['english']

<p>同志们，一切支持佳士工人声援团的正义人士们：  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comrades, all supporter of Jasic Workers Solidarity Group:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2018年12.26日，声援团成员在北京、韶山等多地纪念毛主席诞辰125周年。这本是每一个中国人应引以为荣的活动，谁料却驱使黑恶势力再一次对声援团痛下毒手！</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The left wing comrades of solidarity group organized an event to commemorate the birth of Chairman Mao in Beijing, Shaoshan and other places on December 26, 2018. There are millions of people in China organize relevant activities on this day to express their yearning for a fair society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>在此后的几天里，陆续有9名声援团成员及支持人士被非法抓捕。  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However in the next few days, 9 members of solidarity group and supporters were arrested successively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>黑恶势力不敢明言纪念毛主席违法违纪，更不敢说群众对此的支持使它们担惊受怕，竟以各种荒唐的理由把几人监禁起来。其中一名声援团成员的罪名，便是“盗用身份证”。 </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The evil forces did not dare to pronounce that commemorate the birth of Chairman Mao is a violation of law and discipline, to our surprise, they imprisoned several people on various ridiculous grounds. One of the members of solidarity group was charged with “malversation of identity cards”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>而另外一名声援团成员、北京大学的学生展振振，突然也在纪念活动后失联。仅仅五天后，他遭到强制退学，没有任何申辩机会。 </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And another member of solidarity group, Zhan Zhenzhen who is a student of pku, lost contact after commemorative event suddenly. Only five days later, he was forced to withdraw from school without any defense opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>哪怕单单只有这样，也足以算得上震惊世界的惨案了。但是，黑恶势力远没有停下他们的反动行径。 </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if it is only this, it is enough to shock the world. However, the evil forces are far from stopping their reactionary actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这期间，<strong>南京还有着另外8名大学毕业生被抓捕，至今仍无音讯——倘若大家能回想起2017年发生在南京中医药大学的“8·25致远社事件”，警方以“非法组织”之名强行传唤了参与南中医致远社活动的数名高校左翼学生，便不难理解：这些毕业的左翼同志正是在广州读书会青年勇敢发声的鼓舞下决定发出抗议，要求恢复致远社。在此之下则是黑警对致远社的又一次打压。</strong>通过给致远社扣上“<strong>非法组织</strong>”的帽子、通过逼迫这些学生承认<strong>广州读书会是与致远社互相联系</strong>——从而对广州读书会青年反攻倒算。他们确实值得为这一伟大发明而骄傲。为了给在狱中的同志，给读书会青年中的顾佳悦、徐忠良、郑永明等人罗列针织罪名，广东的黑恶势力只得向本无过错的其他人开刀了。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During this time, there were other 8 graduates in Nanjing was arrested and no imformation yet. If you can recall “8·25 Zhiyuan Society Incident” that happened in Nanjing University Of Chinese Medicine in 2017, the police forcibly summoned several left-wing students who participated in the activities who particapte in the activities of Zhiyuan Society  in the name of “illegal organization”, it is easy for you to understand that these left wing comrades who graduated decided to protest because of the inspiration of the events of the Guangzhou Reading Club at the end of 2017, demanding the restoration of Zhiyuan Society. We speculate that this arrest is an attempt to counter-attack the comrades in the Guangzhou Reading Club incidents such as Gu Jiayue, Zheng Yongming and Xu Zhongliang.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>黑恶势力越是这样迫不及待，越是暴露出自己的无能为力。而这种不计代价的大范围打击，不但不能伤及声援团的根本，更是为他们自己的末日添了一把柴火。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The evil force more eagerly, the more incompetence they exposed. This kind of blow can not hurt the fundamentals of the support group, but it also adds a firewood to their own end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>与此同时，就连两位在北大维权成功的保安曹建、马子胜都被悄无声息地抓进了牢房，罪名是“扰乱社会秩序”。这两位工友此前曾积极参与马会举办的工友之家活动，这便成了扰乱社会秩序的祸根，而直接原因则是北大领导秉承了打压马会的策略，禁止两人进入校园而引起两人的控诉罢了。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, even two ex-security guards of PKU who had successfully defended their rights Cao Jian and Ma Zisheng was secretly arrested and imprisoned with the accusation of disturbing social order. The authority believed that their active participation in the activities which were held by Worker’s House disturbed the social order. And the direct cause is that the PKU admin followed the order of suppressing MS, and forbidden them into the campus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>与此同时，<strong>北大医学部学生冯俊杰再一次莫名失踪。11月底时，冯俊杰就曾被失踪——在学校的恐吓与煽动下，他的父母来到学习场所将他强行带回家中。这一次，难道北大还能对参与谋划俊杰的失踪矢口否认吗？</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, the student of PKU Health Science Center (PKU-HCC) Feng Junjie again disappeared without any notice. Feng has disappeared at the end of November 2018 after his parents forcedly took him home under PKU admin’s intimidation and instigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>而就在昨天，我们再次看到黑恶势力的为所欲为。<strong>一样是在北大医学部，曾经支持声援团并协助转发消息的王梦洁同学被扛进出租车强行带回家，现场上前阻止的同学被学工老师、保卫部人员等死死控制住，有人甚至被牢牢按到在地！校方在这里扮演着什么样的角色？种种事实，我们已经不需要再去猜测什么了。</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At January 17th 2019, another students of PKU-HCC Wang Mengjie who had supported Jasic Workers Support Group and spread struggle information was pulled into a taxi and forcedly took home. The students who wanted to help Meng was controlled by the personnel of PKU’s Student Affair Department and Security Department. These realities unveiled the PKU admin’s role in its students’ disappearance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>如果把这些作为对声援团打压，对进步青年、对马克思主义打压的一个个环节来看，我们就很好理解黑恶势力的所作所为了。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s see what they did step by step to suppress Jasic Worker’s Supporting Group, progressive youth, or the Marxists:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>随意扣上某某罪名，处心积虑制造证据，恐吓家长带走学生，约谈抓捕声援者。我们到要看看，黑恶势力还有什么卑劣手段？</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Label activists with whatever accusation, falsify evidence, threaten students’ parents, intimidate or kidnap the supporters…  are they going to have more ridiculous acts than these?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>一切都是如此清楚明了。可是，他们实在是搬起石头来砸了自己的脚，他们难道看不到自己在背弃人民的道路上越走越远吗？他们难道以为这样就会彻底打倒声援团，彻底压制住进步青年的呼声，压制住马克思主义在社会主义的中国传播，压制住工人阶级用马克思主义武装自己吗？这简直就是痴心妄想。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s already very clear that they’re lifting the rocks only to harm themselves, because they have betrayed the commonwealth.  They think that they can defeat Jasic Worker’s supporters, silence the young activists, suppress Marxism in the ex-socialist China, or forbid Chinese workers to use Marxist weapon?  Then they are day-dreamers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>对尘肺工人的清场，对帮助尘肺工人维权的包子的非法抓捕……这些黑恶势力所打压的绝非只是声援团，而是一切受压迫要反抗的群体，可是，螳臂何以挡车？<strong>打压的愈是厉害，反抗的洪水便愈是汹涌！我们始终相信，人民，只有人民，才是历史的创造者，而一切反人民的黑恶势力都终将被历史所埋葬！</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regarding the crackdown on the pneumoconiosis workers and their supporters (e.g., recently arrested NGO activist Baozi), the evil power consistently crackdown not just Jasic workers and supporters, but any group anti-oppression.  However, where there’s more oppression stimulates more rebellion.   We have always believed that ‘people, only the people, are the creators of history, and those against people will eventually be buried by history.</p>
