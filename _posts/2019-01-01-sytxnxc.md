<p><strong>生于斗争，长于斗争。</strong>这句话用来描述左翼力量在今年的崛起再合适不过。<br />

<strong>左翼力量不是自然而然的生长出来，而正是在反抗压迫的斗争中成长起来。</strong></p>
<p><strong>“可是战斗才是马克思的灵魂，没有了战斗精神，装饰精美的书籍不过是一纸死亡通知书，冠以马克思之名的学院则是埋葬思想的坟墓。”</strong></p>
<p>2018年，是无产阶级革命导师马克思诞辰200周年，也是无产阶级行动的指南、纲领《共产党宣言》发表170周年。<br />
我们欢呼左翼的崛起——在这一年里，<strong>左翼青年以不屈的战斗精神显示出他们的韧劲，坚定的信念和对劳动人民的热爱</strong>。</p>
<p>深圳佳士工人运动揭开了中国知识分子与工人阶级相结合的新篇章。过去半年中，广东黑警近乎疯狂的打压与报复恰恰证明，<strong>知识分子结合工人的伟大实践，刺进了曾作为改革开放的桥头堡，如今却要走上歧途的广东……</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>米久平、余浚聪、刘鹏华、李展……</strong></span>一批先进而觉悟的工人率先迈过了以往工人维权中的经济诉求，力求在资方把控的工厂体系中争得工人的一席之地——工人自己的工会。这种令资产阶级胆寒、令黄色工会尴尬、令反动势力警觉的大胆尝试，遭到了广东黑恶势力无情的摧残和打压。<br />
<strong>当佳士工人要求建立工会的呐喊声直冲云霄，当身为国家主人的工人因为争取权益而身陷牢狱甚至受到刑讯虐待，广大的左翼青年与进步人士岂能袖手旁观？</strong>2018年7月27日，接近30名工人被燕子岭派出所抓捕，引发全球声援浪潮。来自大江南北的正义人士奔赴珠三角，组成了佳士工人声援团，为佳士建会工人奔走呐喊。</p>
<p>令人耳目一新的是，声援团中不乏年轻人的声音。<strong>从不断走向马列毛道路的新一代工人，到全国各地高校的在校大学生，再到摘下名校光环、走入工人的左翼青年，大家一同顶着广东的炎炎夏日，为工人阶级的权益与尊严发声。</strong>一个不争的事实是，新生的左翼力量正高举着“工学联合”的大旗茁壮成长，在斗争中结成牢固的联盟。</p>
<p>在这样大无畏的精神面前，严酷的风雪又算得上什么呢？8月24日对我声援团进行的暴力清场与强制遣返发生后，声援团同志突破重重监禁与封锁，奔赴韶山参加纪念毛主席的活动，各高校学子更是投入到声势浩大的社团保卫战之中。<strong>而11月9日与11日各地突发的秘密抓捕，更没有吓退我们不屈不挠的声援团同志。</strong>即使高校学子面临校方的恐吓甚至铁拳，即使在知名高校中发生了骇人听闻的清场，即使各地的工人随时面临二次抓捕的危险，我们依旧毫不犹豫地接过旗帜、继续吹响战斗的号角！</p>
<p>一百七十年前，马克思高呼出无产阶级运动的箴言：<strong>“全世界无产者，联合起来！”</strong>佳士工人声援团不仅仅是为建会工人而战，更是为普天下备受压迫与剥削的人民而战。<strong>从平度老兵事件，到深圳尘肺工人维权，再到声援全国各地被打压的左翼同志，我们用行动证明自己是工人阶级的声援团、是一切受压迫者的声援团。</strong></p>
<p>马克思主义的道路总会越走越宽的！在持续不断的斗争中，冰雹般纷繁而至的打压反而让声援团的队伍愈发精锐、愈发壮大。<strong>在12月26日毛主席诞辰125周年这个意义重大的日子，四名佳士工人声援团代表再度来到韶山。他们慷慨激昂的演讲、嘹亮有力的歌声赢得了人民群众的喝彩与掌声。来自全国各地、或老或少的正义人士无畏约谈，加入声援团线上线下的队伍中，为营救被捕同志献策献力。</strong></p>
<p>在此，我们想将何敬平烈士的《把牢底坐穿》献给仍在狱中斗争的青年与工人：<strong>“今天，我们坐牢了，坐牢又有什么稀罕？为了免除下一代的苦难，我们愿——愿把这牢底坐穿！”声援团的每一位同志随时准备像狱中的同志一样，今天将一切奉献给无产阶级，明天就戴上与资方沆瀣一气的广东黑警反动的铁链镣铐！</strong></p>
<p>在此，我们想将毛主席的教导献给全国的进步青年共勉：<strong>“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”</strong>工学联合的征程已然开启，我们相信会有更多的青年人投身结合工人的伟大实践，引领历史的新潮！</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;">回望2018年，佳士工人声援团披荆斩棘、乘风破浪。</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#800000;">展望2019年，同志仍在狱中，工人尚未解放，吾辈仍需团结奋斗。</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#800000;">同志们，让我们下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利！</span></strong></p>

### 英文版
Born in struggle, grown in struggle. These are perfect words to describe the power of Left-Wing that springs up this year. It doesn't come naturally, however, it's steeled in struggles against oppression.

"But the spirit of Marxism is fighting. Without fighting spirit, well-decorated books is no more than a death notice, and the academy to be named Marxism is just the grave to bury thoughts."

The year of 2018, was the 200th anniversary of Karl Marx birth, and the 170th anniversary of the publication of the Communist Manifesto. Nevertheless, the Revolutionary theories have been shaped as harmless idols standing in temples; The heartless and blood-thirsted bourgeoisie have returned; and sweat, blood, and tears of the working class flow under the neon lights of the prospering metropolis. “Today, a miasmal mist once more rising, we hail Sun Wukong, the wonder-worker.” The rebelling scream of the working class shattered the dreams of illusive peace, and the war songs of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism once again echoed over the land of China.

The Jasic Worker Movement in Shenzhen revealed the new chapter of the solidarity between the Chinese students and working class. The insane crackdown and retaliation by the reactionary powers in the past year had proved that the great practice of intelligentsia-worker solidarity, like a sharp bayonet, stabbed into Guangdong,the leading province of ‘Reform and Opening-up’.

Mi Jiuping, Yu Juncong, Liu Penghua, Li Zhan…a generation of progressive and conscious workers bypassed the stage of pure-economical appealing in the former worker movements; instead, they strived in order to earn a seat in the factory systems which was long held by the capitalists – to form a worker’s own labor union. This bold attempt terrified the capitalists, embarrassed the puppet union, and warned the reactive powers, and resulted in ruthless suppressions.

When the appeal for a labor union by the Jasic Workers echoed, when the workers, being constitutionally “the ruling class of the country”, got arrested or even tortured for striving for their own benefit, how could the left-wing just stand aside? On July 27th, 2018, about 30 workers were arrested in Yanziling Police Station, which aroused the voices of solidarity from all around the world. People striving for justice gathered in Pearl River Delta and formed the Jasic Worker Supporting Group, and cried for justice for the Jasic workers.

Fresh to all of us, there were numbers of young voices in the Supporting Group. From the new generations of workers who were walking on their way to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, to students from universities all over China, to the left youths who abandoned their fame as elite-college graduates and stood along with the workers. They stood together under the scorching sun of Guangdong, exclaimed for the rights and the pride of the working class. It’s now an indisputable fact that the fresh Left-Wing is growing steadily under the banner of the Solidarity of Workers and Students, and is forming an unbreakable alliance during the struggle.

With fearless spirits, harsh storm is nothing to us. After the crackdown on Aug. 24th, some JSG comrades escaped the authority’s stalking and made their way to join the event commemorating chairman Mao in Shaoshan (Mao’s hometown). Students from various universities also launched the defense against the repression of left-wing student organizations, representing the rebellious sparkles around the nation. Even the abrupt sneaky arrest at multiple cities in early November didn’t deter our unyielding comrades, who will continue to fight without hesitation.With fearless spirits, harsh storm is nothing to us.

Even the abrupt sneaky arrest at multiple cities in early November didn’t deter our unyielding comrades, who will continue to fight without hesitation.

170 years ago, Karl Marx wrote down the maxim of proletariat movement: “Workers of the world, unite!” The Jasic Worker Supporting Group stands not only for the workers who were striving for a labor union, but for all our comrades of the working class who are currently under suppression and exploitation. From the veterans in Pingdu, to the Black Lung workers in Shenzhen, and to all of our comrades under suppression in our country, we have proved ourselves with action supporting the working class, and the supporting all the oppressed ones.

The road of Marxism will be broadened! During our endeavor, the hailstorm of suppression instead made stronger and stronger. On December 26th, the 125th birthday of Chairman Mao Zedong, 4 representatives of Supporting Group went to his birth place, Shaoshan. Their passionating speeches and ringing voices of songs earned the bravo from the audience. People from all parts of the country, fearless of the tricks of the authority, joined the Supporting Group for justice and provided their effort to rescue the arrested comrades.

For the comrades who are still struggling in jail, we share a poem by HE Jingping, a communist who was killed in prison before the dawn of new China in 1949:

Today,
We’re in jail, so what?!

For the generations to come

Free from suffering

We’re willing

Willing to fight

until the prison is blasted to the ground!

Everyone of JSG is ready to stand with the comrades in capitalist-backed prison, and to sacrifice everything for the liberation of working class. At this turning point, a quote of chairman Mao is most appropriate from all progressive youth around country:

‘To see whether a youth is revolutionary or not, what is the criterion? The only criterion is to see if he/she is willing to join and work with the massive working people.’

The journey of worker-student alliance has just initiated. We believe, there will be more people joining this great journey, being the leading force of history!

Looking back on 2018, the Jasic Workers’ Supporting Group has overcome all kinds of suppressions.

Looking forward to 2019, our comrades are still in prison, workers have not yet been liberated.

Thus, we have to maintain the solidarity and continue the struggle.

Comrades, let’s make up our minds, fear no losses, eliminate all difficulties, and strive for victory!
